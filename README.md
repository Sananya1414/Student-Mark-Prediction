## Dataset

The dataset includes information on previous grades, attendance records, study hours, and socio-economic factors of students. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the `data/raw` directory before running the preprocessing script.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. The `preprocess.py` script performs these steps and saves the processed data in the `data/processed` directory.

## Model Selection

Various machine learning models are evaluated to select the best one for predicting student marks. The models considered include linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

## Training and Evaluation

The selected model is trained on the processed dataset, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are saved and visualized using Matplotlib.

## Deployment

The trained model can be deployed as a web application or an API for real-time predictions.
